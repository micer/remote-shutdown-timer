# Remote Shutdown Timer
This project should support my laziness and allow me to set up shutdown or sleep timer on the computer from my Android phone without having to get up from the couch. ;-)

However, the real and main purpose of this code is to implement a simple app from scratch and improve my knowledge of MVVM pattern (data binding, yay!) as well as known Android libraries like [Dagger 2](https://google.github.io/dagger/), [Butterknife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/), [Retrolambda](https://github.com/evant/gradle-retrolambda), [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/), [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/), [Mockito](http://site.mockito.org/), [Espresso framework](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/test/espresso/Espresso.html) and others.

Since there's `work-in-progress`, check the [project branches](https://github.com/micer/remote-shutdown-timer/branches).
