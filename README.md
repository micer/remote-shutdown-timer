# Remote Shutdown Timer
This project should support my laziness and allow me to set up shutdown or sleep timer from my Android phone without having to get up from the couch. ;-)

However, the real and main purpose of this code is to implement a simple app from scratch and improve knowledge of MVVM pattern (data binding, yay!) and well known Android libraries like Dagger 2, Butterknife, Retrolambda, Retrofit, OkHttp, Mockito, Espresso and others.
